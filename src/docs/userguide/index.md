The **[{% include "icons/fa-file-pdf.svg" %} MATSim user guide (pdf)](/files/book/partOne-latest.pdf)**
is an extract and update of the [MATSim book](/the-book).  

The user guide chapters contain the most relevant topics for new users.

The user guide is typically updated along with the MATSim class that we teach at TU Berlin every year between April and July.
