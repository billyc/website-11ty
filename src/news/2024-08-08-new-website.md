If you read this post, than you will likely have noticed that the MATSim website looks different.
We are happy to present the new MATSim website!

Besides a visual refresh, the new website offers a variety of improvements:

- Mobile friendly! 
  Finally you are able to read the MATSim website also on mobile devices with smaller screens.
- Better differentiation between News and Job offers. 
  We are happy to see so many job openings that apply to people with strong MATSim skills, but the not-job-related news kind of got lost in the old site.
- Show cases from industry users of MATSim. 
  The number of MATSim users outside of academia is steadily growing for many years now, but this fact was not very well known â€” until now.
- More information about the MATSim Association.

We hope you enjoy the new site!
