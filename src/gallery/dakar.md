The modal of Dakar, Senegal, was created during the D4D challenge (Data for Development).
The travel demand is created using mobile phone data, and simulated on a network extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM).

The process is implemented in a prototype software called SPOT (Spatial Planning simulation
and Optimization Technologies), which uses MATSim for the traffic simulation.
