<b>MATSim DRT</b> is used to plan ridepooling service in new environments.
</aside>

With its business unit [Mobility Consulting](https://solutions.moia.io/en/mobility-consulting), 
the ridepooling provider MOIA develops and applies MATSim to conceptualise and assess 
existing and new ridepooling services. 
MATSim's DRT extension has proven to replicate MOIA's ridepooling operation realistically 
and allows detailed and transparent planning of the service in new environments.

Applications in various cities.
</aside>

MATSim has been used for ridepooling simulations in MOIA's operational cities Hamburg and 
Hanover, but also to assess new service concepts of ridepooling for customers in Munich, 
Zurich or Graz.
For the visualisation of its simulations, MOIA uses and develops together with 
Simunto the Volkswagen-owned [Mobility Impact Analyzer (MIA)](https://www.moia.io/en/blog/mia-mobility-impact-analyzer) 
that makes the simulation findings easily accessible for experts and non-experts.
